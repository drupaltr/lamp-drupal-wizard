The following script is taken from Linode.com and is a collection of two scripts that will install and configure a LAMP server and optimize it to use Drupal/Pressflow.

The script was adapted so you can run it from shell, it was tested on Ubuntu 10.04 but it should work on other Ubuntu/Debian installations, if it does please report it back to lelizondo at gmail.com

The script IS NOT INTENDED TO BE USED IN A RUNNING SERVER. Use this script only to configure a server after you have installed it.

This script is provided "AS IS" with no warranty.

To run the script you first have to make it executable with:
